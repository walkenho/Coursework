Q1: Find the names of all reviewers who rated Gone with the Wind. 
A1: select distinct name from 
    (Reviewer join Rating using(rID)) join Movie using(mID)
    where title = "Gone with the Wind"

Q2: For any rating where the reviewer is the same as the director of the
    movie, return the reviewer name, movie title, and number of stars. 
A2: select name, title, stars
    from
    (Movie join Rating using(mID)) join Reviewer using(rID)
    where director = name;

Q3: Return all reviewer names and movie names together in a single list,
    alphabetized. (Sorting by the first name of the reviewer and first word in the
    title is fine; no need for special processing on last names or removing
    "The".) 
A3: select name
    from Reviewer
    union
    select title as name
    from Movie
    order by name

Q4: Find the titles of all movies not reviewed by Chris Jackson.
A4: select title 
    from Movie
    where mID not in
    (select mID
    from
    (Reviewer join Rating using(rID)) join Movie using(mID)
    where name = "Chris Jackson");

Q5: For all pairs of reviewers such that both reviewers gave a rating to the
    same movie, return the names of both reviewers. Eliminate duplicates, don't
    pair reviewers with themselves, and include each pair only once. For each
    pair, return the names in the pair in alphabetical order. 
A5: select distinct R1.name, R2.name
    from
    (select Rating1.rID as rID1, Rating2.rID as rID2
    from Rating as Rating1, Rating as Rating2
    where Rating1.mID = Rating2.mID and Rating1.rID <> Rating2.rID) Rs
    join (select * from Reviewer) R1 on Rs.rID1 = R1.rID
    join (select * from Reviewer) R2 on Rs.rID2 = R2.rID
    where R1.name < R2.name
