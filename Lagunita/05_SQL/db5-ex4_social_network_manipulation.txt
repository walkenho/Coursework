Q1: It's time for the seniors to graduate. Remove all 12th graders from Highschooler. 
A1: delete from highschooler where grade = 12;

Q2: If two students A and B are friends, and A likes B but not vice-versa, remove the Likes tuple. 
A2: delete from likes 
    where exists (select * from friend 
                   where likes.id1 = friend.id1 
                         and likes.id2 = friend.id2        
                         and not exists (select * from likes l2 
                                                  where likes.id1 = l2.id2                  
                                                        and likes.id2 = l2.id1));

Q3: For all cases where A is friends with B, and B is friends with C, add a
    new friendship for the pair A and C. Do not add duplicate friendships,
    friendships that already exist, or friendships with oneself. (This one is a
    bit challenging; congratulations if you get it right.)
A3:
insert into friend
select distinct AB.id1, BC.id2 from friend AB join friend BC 
       where AB.id2 = BC.id1 
             and AB.id1 < BC.id2 
             and not exists (select * from friend friendcheck
                                where AB.id1 = friendcheck.id1 
                                      and BC.id2 = friendcheck.id2)
union 
select distinct BC.id2, AB.id1 from friend AB join friend BC 
       where AB.id2 = BC.id1 
             and AB.id1 < BC.id2 
             and not exists (select * from friend friendcheck
                                where AB.id1 = friendcheck.id1 
                                      and BC.id2 = friendcheck.id2)
(The trick is to realize that all friendschips have to be inserted twice, once
in each order!)
